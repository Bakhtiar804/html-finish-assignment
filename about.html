    <p>“My name is <strong>Bakhtiar Ahmed</strong>.I am an enthusiastic and motivated individual with a strong passion
        for<i> Web Development</i> and continuous learning.
        I enjoy creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites using front-end technologies like <b>HTML, CSS,
            and
            JavaScript</b>, and I am eager to expand my expertise in advanced frameworks and back-end development. I
        believe in
        writing clean, efficient code and exploring innovative solutions to bring ideas to life.Beyond technology, I
        have a great passion for cricket, a sport that inspires me with its lessons of teamwork, patience, and strategy.
        Just like coding, cricket requires focus, adaptability, and problem-solving — qualities I apply in both my
        professional and personal growth. <br>
        My goal is to build a career as a Web Developer, contributing to impactful projects while continuing to improve
        my skills and following my passions both in technology and sports.”</p>
